Take control of all the cells on the board by clicking an adjacent cell to send half of your army there. Some of the cells you'll encounter will help and add to your total body count and other will hurt and subtract.

When you encounter an enemy you two will battle it by subtracting the amount of cells sent over!

The game can be played [here](https://karinchung.github.io/risk/)
